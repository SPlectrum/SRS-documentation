# SPlectrum SRS Documentation

This is not about producing detailed end-to-end documentation, more about providing short descriptions of what has achieved already some clarity.  
It is supposed to be a reflection of a journey of exploration.

- Have a look at the [achievements](achievements.md) so far. The SPlectrum platform will be created through iteration.  
Although there are clear ideas for the headlines it should cover, this are not worked out up front.  
Its specification should grows through the iterations of its concepts.

- There is a [document with a list of keypoints](key-points.md).  
There is an attemp to keep it concise, and it may branch out to longer explanations.  
However, the main aim is to reduce key points to their simplest form and transform them into rules.

- Som notes [on the next iteration](to-the-next-poc.md): [spl1](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1)
