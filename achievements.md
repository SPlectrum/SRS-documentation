# Achievements

1. A preliminary POC [hello-splectrum](https://github.com/SPlectrum/hello-splectrum) implementing an initial execution context and request execution routine.

2. The next POC was the [spl0](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl0) project which implements the execution engine and command parsing and execution.  
It allows the creation of app through its capability to create command of command batches and JS scripts.  
I already showcases a number of the design patterns and initial exploration of AI directed development clarified the roadmap for the next step.

3. [spl1](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1) will focus ensuring clear and simple design patterns for the core and app structure.  
The aims is to translate these in clear rules to maximise the impact of AI driven development.  
The available functionality will be expanded to make the apps more powerfull.  
It should make a start with a set of platform management tools.
