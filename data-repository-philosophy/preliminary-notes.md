# Preliminary Notes

The platform has two types of repositories: static and dynamic.

The static repositories contain the change log data of the data structures created on the platform.  
The data that is created from it in the form of representations is dynamic data and stored in repositories within the runtime.  
Any additional metadata that is created by runtime time processes is also stored within the runtime in repositories.

This needs some working out ...
