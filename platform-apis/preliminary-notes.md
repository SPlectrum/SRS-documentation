# Preliminary Notes

There are a number of commmon APIs that all applications inherit.  
I am not sure yet how these will be split, it is basically platform functionality that applies to all.  
These API come with associated data structures - I used to call these facets in an earlier project.

The following APIs come to mind: 
 - Install ()
 - Runtime (boot, shutdown, halt, recover )
 - Backup
 - Life cycle API ( configure, build, deploy, test, run )
 - Info and Help API
