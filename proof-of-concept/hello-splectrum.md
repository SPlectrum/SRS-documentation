# Hello SPlectrum

This initial POC is implemented in its own repository: [hello-splectrum](https://github.com/SPlectrum/hello-splectrum).

The aim is to set up a basic request execution pipeline using the correct paradigms.  
Of main interest is how requests get prepared, execution plans set and requests executed.  
Of importance is as well that there a proper record of all steps executed.  
It should be easy for the system to recover from failure / abort.
