# Hello SPlectrum

This initial POC is implemented in its own repository: [hello-splectrum](https://github.com/SPlectrum/hello-splectrum).

The aim is to set up a basic request execution pipeline using the correct paradigms.  
Of main interest is how requests get prepared, execution plans set and requests executed.  

The POC aims to cover the following through a number of iterations:
 - start with a simple direct execution of the hello-splectrum steps
 - create a single pipeline and request execution plan
 - set up the execution context
 - create a deployable asset.
