# Preliminary Notes

The platform is seen as only a building block that allows to create more complex processing structures.  

SPlectrum powers a platform to run data streaming applications.  
Functionality is contained in the modules folder.  
SPlectrum provides the core functionaltiy.

There is a common structure to everything that runs on SPlectrum,  
(see folder structure)

A platform instance is just a node in processing land.  
Complex functionality should apply separation of concern and multinode design. (thiking of permissions/security/etc.)  
The resulting application will be logical one, but may physically reside in various locations.  
The aim is to employ the platform in peer-to-peer scenarions.  

I will look at the way life expresses itself as an example of how to approach it.  
A platform node can be seen as a cell.  
In multicellular scenarios all nodes will have full information to construct and run the whole entity.  
Install / deploy strategy is taking from cell/DNA/RNA analogue.  
This should also cover the growing / maturing as a way to install and run.
